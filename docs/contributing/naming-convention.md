# Contributing Naming Convention

## General Guidelines

This document outlines the naming conventions for our project. These conventions are intended to promote consistency and clarity across different components.

### Specific Conventions

#### Python Code

  **Style**: We follow the official Python Enhancement Proposal 8 [PEP8]((https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names) ) guidelines for naming conventions.

#### Jupyter Notebooks

 **File Names**: File names should start with an underscore (_). Please use underscores instead of hyphens.

#### Documentation

 **Directory and File Names**: Directory and file names should use hyphens (-) instead of underscores.

#### Tests

1. **Test File and Function Names**: Test files and functions should start with `test_`.
2. **Additional Guidelines**: For additional guidelines, please refer to the [pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/explanation/goodpractices.html#conventions-for-python-test-discovery).

!!! note "Test File Naming Convention"
    We do not use the _test.py suffix for test files
